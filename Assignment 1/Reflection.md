# Reflection on My Art vs Chatgpt's Art

When looking at both mine vs chatgpts art its clear that chatgpt's version is better. My Art is much simpler and rudimentary because i 
only used squares, rectangles, circles and ellipses that can only use a set of coordinates to place it, making it harder to rotate or position things
exactly where i want them. Chatgpt on the other hand isnt restrained by these, only the prompt given. I gave chatgpt the same prompt i was given 
to do this assignment, to create your favorite food using only simple shapes. Chatgpt did what it was told to do and did it much better than i could have.
The image that was generated was great! The overall composition of the picture was great and the color scheme fit in as well.
