# Reflection of P5 and Chatgpt
## Landon Vernon


I decided to change the way chatgpt made the art by giving me code instead of a picture. I gave it the same prompt that
I was given for this assignment, to really see what it would come up with. Chatgpt followed the instructions to the letter but
only made a very rudimentary sandwich with limited interactibility. Mine on the other hand, is similiar in some regards
but has a better overall image and interactability. This is in part due to our ability to think outside of the instructions and
go beyond just what i am told to do. Chatgpt on the other hand only does what you instruct it to do, if i tell it to make a BLT
in P5, its going to just make a simple sandwich out of shapes but if i told it to make subway order that has very detailed instructions
about where everything goes and how everythiing should loook, it would churn out a better image because it has more data to work off of.
