# Assignment 3 Reflection
## Landon Vernon

I decided to use Chatgpt as the LLM of choice, mostly because its the one I really use the most and it's pretty helpful
when it comes to images and also questions so its kind of my go to. I asked chatgpt to generate an image of what it thought 
the edge of the universe looked like. It proceeded to tell me that the edge of the universe is theoretical and that we can 
only speculate as to what it looks like, but chatgpt generated it anyways and came up with an amazing image of the 
edge of the universe, it wasnt really what i expected because there is so much color, i expected it to be a lot darker with
smaller blots of light and dust but who knows, maybe chatgpt knows more than we think.
